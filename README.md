## 📠 C++ Advanced Calculator
This is an advanced calculator that I made during my time in college. It is able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division equations while displaying a clean and eligible command line interface. 
## ✨ Technologies
- C++
- CLI
- Login System (Limited Functionality)
- Mathmatical Processes
## 🚀 Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
## 📌 The Reason
I made this application during my time in college to show that I am knowledgeable about data types, accepting user input, using
loops, using functions that accept parameters, using references, using pointers, using header files, using classes and child
classes that clearly displays inheritance, and the difference between private and public encapsulation.
## 📖 How To Use
When you run the application you have the choice of logging in as a registered user or a guest (this has no impact on how the
application is used). Once the user is logged in they can chose to either create an addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
division equation. After the user makes thier selection they can input the first and second number in the equation. Once both
numbers are answered the full equation is shown with the answer to the equation and the user is asked if they would like to
calculate another equation.
